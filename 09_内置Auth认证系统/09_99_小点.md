First make sure you have `SessionMiddleware` and `AuthenticationMiddleware` middlewares added to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting.

The current `user` is in `request` object, you can get it by:

```python
def sample_view(request):
    current_user = request.user
    print current_user.id
    print current_user  # username is shown
```

`request.user` will give you a `User` object representing the currently logged-in user. If a user isn't currently logged in, `request.user` will be set to an instance of `AnonymousUser`. You can tell them apart with the field `is_authenticated`, like so:

```python
if request.user.is_authenticated:
    # Do something for authenticated users.
else:
    # Do something for anonymous users.
```

FROM WITHIN THE TEMPLATES

This is how I usually get current logged in user and their id in my templates.

```python
<p>Your Username is : {{user}} </p>
<p>Your User Id is  : {{user.id}} </p>
```




This is how I usually get current logged in user and their id in my templates.

```python
<p>Your Username is : {{user|default: Unknown}} </p>
<p>Your User Id is  : {{user.id|default: Unknown}} </p>
```
